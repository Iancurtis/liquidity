* Create separate persistence library for events to avoid including them in models
* Enable snapshot store because as per http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.10/scala/persistence.html: "Note that Cluster
  Sharding is using snapshots, so if you use Cluster Sharding you need to define a snapshot store plugin."
  See also http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/cluster-sharding.html#Configuration, and remember to update the
  backup scripts.
* Rename play-json-rpc-testkit as play-json-testkit
* Review keystore format (see https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/20381)
* Review use of (in)definite articles in testsuite names
* Add newlines as appropriate at start of blocks
* Name args where appropriate
* Convert persistence ID from from ZoneId(uuid) to zoneid-uuid
* Improve logs
* Create a health-check tool based on LiquidityServerSpec
* Finalise cipher config (see http://typesafehub.github.io/ssl-config/CipherSuites.html and
  http://typesafehub.github.io/ssl-config/TestingSSL.html, be sure to test Android 4.0.4, but also use
  https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=liquidity.dhpcs.com&hideResults=on)
* Restore Cassandra testing but only as integration test
